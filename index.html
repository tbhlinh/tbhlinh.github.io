<h3>Interactive Visualization</h3>

<p>This scatterplot is one of the interactive visualizations I created using the graduates dataset, which contains data on graduates in the past 3 decades. It currently displays the total number of people who graduated across 47 different majors. Each major can have up to 11 points, each of which corresponds to a year. The year is indicated by color. The user can have the choice to change the y-axis to several options, including the number of females within the major, the number of minorities within the major, and the mean salary for each major. The x-axis is intentionally unchangeable, so it will always represent the same 47 majors.</p>
